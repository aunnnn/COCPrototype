Drag-to-slash-demon iOS game (prototype)
* drag to move a samurai around the field
* drag near demons to slash them, and to increase the magic gauge
* but not too fast, beware the people, don't slash them!
* if the magic gauge is filled, double tap for rage mode, in this mode samurai will not interact with people, feel free to move around at full speed!
